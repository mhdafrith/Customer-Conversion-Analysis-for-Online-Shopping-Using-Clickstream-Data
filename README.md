# Customer Conversion Analysis for Online Shopping Using Clickstream Data

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer conversion for online shopping using clickstream data. The goal is to develop a Streamlit web application that leverages machine learning models to predict customer conversion, estimate potential revenue, and segment customers based on their browsing behavior.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **Reg_clustering.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing code for regression and clustering models.
- **data_preprocessing_eda_modeling.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building.
- **model.pkl**: Serialized machine learning model for deployment.
- **output_2.png**: Example output or visualization generated during the project.
- **streamlit_deploy.py**: Python script for deploying the Streamlit web application.

## Key Features

1. **Customer Conversion Prediction**: Predict whether a customer will complete a purchase based on their browsing behavior.
2. **Revenue Estimation**: Estimate the potential revenue a customer is likely to generate.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers into distinct groups based on their online behavior patterns.
